# Header at Level 1

Headers appear on a line of their own. A header starts with the one or more occurrences of the symbol `#` followed
by one space followed by text *and ends with a newline. 
Headers are section _*titles.*_ The number of `#` symbols *_indica*te_ the _nesting of *headers. 


## This is a header at level 2

Paragraphs are *separated* by new lines.

# Numbered Lists 

Numbered lists appear on a separate line and start with two special characters `1.` followed by a space. 
For example here is a numbered lists 

1. This is the *first* item 
1. the second item 
1. the third item

We end an ordered list with an empty line.
We can nest ordered lists by adding 2 spaces followed by the same special character for numbered lists, e.g., 

1. This is the first item of the outer list 
1. This is the second item of the outer list 
  1. This is the first item of the inner list 
  1. This is the second item of the inner list 
1. This is the third item of the outer list
