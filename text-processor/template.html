<h1>Header at Level 1</h1>

<br />

<p>Headers appear on a line of their own. A header starts with the one or more occurrences of the symbol `#` followed
by one space followed by text <strong>and ends with a newline. </strong>Headers are section <em><strong>titles.</strong></em> The number of `#` symbols <strong><em>indica</strong>te</em> the <em>nesting of <strong>headers. </em></strong></p>

<br />

<h2>This is a header at level 2 </h2>

<br />

<h1>Paragraphs</h1>

<br />

<p>Paragraphs are free form text.
Paragraphs are <strong>separated</strong> by new lines.
</p>

<p>This is the second paragraph in this section
</p>

<br />

<h1>Numbered Lists </h1>

<br />

<p>Numbered lists appear on a separate line and start with two special characters `1.` followed by a space. 
For example here is a numbered lists 
</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the <strong>first</strong> item</li>
<li>the second item</li>
<li>the third item</li>
</ol>

<p>We end an ordered list with an empty line.
We can nest ordered lists by adding 2 spaces followed by the same special character for numbered lists, e.g., 
</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the first item of the outer list</li>
<li>This is the second item of the outer list
<ol>
<li>This is the first item of the inner list</li>
<li>This is the second item of the inner list</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This is the third item of the outer list</li>
</ol>
